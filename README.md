# Beatmatching

Beatmatching is the act that DJs use to synch to separate songs together.

Your goal in this lab is to use VirtualDJ Home, a free DJ application to sync two tracks. You will have to adjust the pitch of the track in order to create a tempo match.

You will then need to adjust the phrasing of the track, by using the decks or pressing play more on beat.

*YOU MAY NOT USE THE SYNC BUTTON*

The goal here is to get a sense of when a track sounds:

1. Too Fast
2. Too Slow
3. Off Phrase

## Download Virtual DJ

Go to [VirtualDJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/download/free.html) download the application. Install it. Register for the site. Start it up.

## Picking Tracks

You want to pick tracks that are probably within 8-12 BPM of each other to begin with. Genres tend to stick to certain BPMs, so pick two hiphop tracks, or two house tracks, or two techno tracks.

I'm using: [Sexual Healing](https://soundcloud.com/nickraymondg/marvin-gaye-sexual-healing) and [Somewhere Over the Rainbow](https://soundcloud.com/thomasjackmusic/israel-kamakawiwoole-1)

## Matching Tempo

We want to manipulate a track so that both tracks tempos match up.

Adjust the pitch on your two tracks so they are set the same.

## Matching Phrase

The goal here is to get both beats of the tracks to play together. That's considered on-phrase.

Virtual DJ represents a beat by a grid on the top. Each track gets its on color. Watch the gif below. The tracks are in sync in terms of tempo, just not phrase. Then I line them up by adjusting their pitch or manipulating the deck (or platter).

So play with the pitch or the platter and try to get your tracks to align.

*DONT FORGET - USE YOUR EARS. Think about if its behind or ahead. Adjust one track to pitch*

## BONUS - Choosing a Good Phrase

Now if you're just going for tempo and phrase match, you are a poor DJ.

Think about it, lots of things are beats, you have a drum, a bass, a high (like a hi hat), lots of sounds. Which do you want to sync up? Both bass drums? Create the phrasing that sounds best.
